## Front-matter of Posts

Finally, I created my very first blog website. As graduation approaches, I realized that I have fallen behind many of my peers, and it feels like I haven’t left behind many memorable things from my university life—whether in learning or in daily life. From today on, I hope to build the habit of blogging, both to push myself to study and to leave something I can look back on.

I’m still a beginner in programming, so if there are any mistakes in my blog, please feel free to reach out to me. And of course, if you just want to make friends, you are more than welcome as well.

In any case, this marks a new beginning for me.

Please note my blog and my connections are based on the following languages.

| Language     | preference                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `English`       | currently the main language of my blog , as it is smoother for me to communicate before my Japanese proficiency improves further                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `日本語`   | I am doing my best to learn Japanese, and I hope to make it the language I use most in my daily life                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `简体中文` | my native language                                                                                                        

Anyway, Let's GO. I would say this is the only code that I have really commended so I am really a noob in CS now, but I will grow and learn more.
